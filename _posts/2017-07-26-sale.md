Hi everyone, there are many steamed beans cakes left from yesterday here and no one wants to eat them — which is totally understandable, they’re horrible.

\(look at how horrible these things look!) ljasdjflkj

test does this thing work? seems ok

So we’re selling them for half the price: **2 smackers** each!

If you’re interested please let me know or go look for me near the bakery.
